<h1> What Happened in China's Cat Market?</h1>
<br>
<br>
<div class="all">

<div class="shop"><h2>Cats in the Pet Stores</h2>
<p>In the past, I usually thought those cats in the pet shops are really cute. However, after having my own cat, I realized that the pets in the pets shop is quite poor. They are at their young stage during which they enjoy running and playing around. However, they are restricted to stay in a mini box in those pet shops. The ones that are not sold at a young age face even worse fate.</p>
<p> The below report showed how the cats were treated in the pet shops:
<p>"According to Cai Chunhong, cats and dogs kept for breeding spend their entire life in cages and females are given injections to keep them in heat. Animals that go unsold can still turn a profit: they are kept in captivity and their blood is harvested for sale to vets.</p>
<p>Cai compares the interest in pet ownership by some people with that of branded luxury handbags: “They’re not keeping pets because they love pets, but because it’s trendy. They don’t keep them long before finding it too much work and abandoning the pets. Many pets end up as strays.”</p>

  <h2>Pet Cats Are Popular Around Younger Generations</h2>
  <p>At current growth rates there will be 300 million pet cats and dogs in China by 2022. Valued at less than 20 billion yuan (US$3 billion) in 2010, those markets were worth 170 billion yuan (US$18 billion) in 2018.</p>
  <p>Surprisingly, it is the young who are driving most of the growth, with about three quarters of pet cat and dog owners having been born in the 1980s and 90s.</p>
  <p>Deng Muxing, 25, opened a pet shop in Xi’an in late 2017. He said 13 pet shops and veterinary practices have opened within a 3km radius. “The people buying pets from me are increasingly young couples, or well-off singles.”</p>
  <p>Cai Chunhong said pets in China tend to be bought, rather than adopted, as people prefer pedigrees and don’t know much about options to adopt. The good breeders are expensive and can’t keep up with demand, so black-market traders have stepped in, breeding pets at the lowest possible cost to maximise profits.</p>
  <p>Deng said food, cleaning and immunisation costs make running a good pet shop expensive; some shops even employ full-time groomers. But buyers can’t always tell whether a shop is well run.</p>

<h2 class="black"> Some of My Thoughts </h2>
<p class="black"> Although I'm writing about some negative sides of the pet shops in China, I'm not saying that all the pet shop in China have these problems or are treating animals in a bad manner. What I realized is that since there are more and more people wanting to buy a cat, there are more shops who join this market only because it is profitable so they do not care about the health of the pet cats. If you really like some specific pet cat breed, I would say buy the ones you like is totally fine. However, if you just want a cute cat as pet, maybe you could also consier about adopting a homeless cat as they are very adorable too and they really need a home.
