<h1> What Happened in China's Cat Market?</h1>
<br>
<div class="p2divs">
<h2>Who is buying all the pets?</h2>
<p>At current growth rates there will be 300 million pet cats and dogs in China by 2022. Valued at less than 20 billion yuan (US$3 billion) in 2010, those markets were worth 170 billion yuan (US$18 billion) in 2018.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it is the young who are driving most of the growth, with about three quarters of pet cat and dog owners having been born in the 1980s and 90s.</p>
<p>Deng Muxing, 25, opened a pet shop in Xi’an in late 2017. He said 13 pet shops and veterinary practices have opened within a 3km radius. “The people buying pets from me are increasingly young couples, or well-off singles.”</p>
<p>Cai Chunhong said pets in China tend to be bought, rather than adopted, as people prefer pedigrees and don’t know much about options to adopt. The good breeders are expensive and can’t keep up with demand, so black-market traders have stepped in, breeding pets at the lowest possible cost to maximise profits.</p>
<p>Deng said food, cleaning and immunisation costs make running a good pet shop expensive; some shops even employ full-time groomers. But buyers can’t always tell whether a shop is well run.</p>

<h2>They become breeding machines..</h2>
<p>According to Cai Chunhong, cats and dogs kept for breeding spend their entire life in cages and females are given injections to keep them in heat. Animals that go unsold can still turn a profit: they are kept in captivity and their blood is harvested for sale to vets.</p>
<p>Cai compares the interest in pet ownership by some people with that of branded luxury handbags: “They’re not keeping pets because they love pets, but because it’s trendy. They don’t keep them long before finding it too much work and abandoning the pets. Many pets end up as strays.”</p>
