<h1> What Happened to The Homeless Cats?</h1>
<br>
<div class="p2divs">
<h2>Homeless cats problem in Beijing and Shanghai</h2>
<p>
  Beijing has a cat problem: Somewhere between 500,000 and 5 million feral cats are skulking through its courtyard houses, construction sites, and gated apartment complexes, braving the city’s bitter cold winters and raging traffic. Their lives are nasty, brutish, and short.
</p>
<p>
  And in a densely populated city like Beijing, the rise in the number of feral cat colonies is not especially welcome. The cats’ nighttime howls keep people awake. They smell. They prey on the Asian magpie and the Siberian weasel, sometimes known as the "hutong weasel," a ferret-like creature that looks a little like a cute red panda. The cats tend to prefer a perch on the BMWs of the city’s nouveau riche.
</p>
<p>
Cats are everywhere in Shanghai. Nearly every public park and apartment complex has its own resident pack of strays, lovingly pampered by local residents like Zhang. Many spend hundreds of yuan per month on cat food alone.
</p>
<p>
But little has been done to manage the city’s street cats, and the result has been a rapidly growing population. Local authorities estimate there could be as many as 3 million stray cats in Shanghai — around 20 for each residential community in the city.

<h2>Feeding homeless cats lead to bad neighborhood relationship</h2>
<p>
For Zhang, feeding the stray cats outside her apartment block has become a high-stakes stealth activity.
</p>
<p>
Usually, she waits until after dark before sneaking out to lay down some kibble. If she has to go during the day, she first puts on a hat, face mask, and sunglasses to conceal her identity.
</p>
<p>
Around 60 felines have taken up residence in Zhang’s housing complex — a large, modern development in eastern Shanghai — and their presence has split the neighborhood’s roughly 1,000 households into two polarized factions.
</p>
<p>
The cat lovers are determined to care for the animals. They’ve assembled a huddle of small shelters and leave out piles of cat food each day. But they face bitter opposition from the community’s anti-cat residents, who complain about loud midnight yowling and occasional attacks on pet dogs.
</p>
<p>
Relations between the groups are tense. On one occasion, the cat haters demolished the shelters during the night, forcing the cat lovers to rebuild them in a discreet spot behind some shrubs. Those bold enough to lay out kibble in broad daylight risk verbal abuse from passing locals.
</p>
<p>
Zhang, a former teacher in her 50s, feels stuck in the middle. She’s so concerned about her neighbors discovering her pro-cat sympathies, she refuses to reveal her full name to Sixth Tone.
</p>
<p>
“Every time I install a cat house or put out food in the compound, I … fear some residents will object and confront me and my family,” she says.
