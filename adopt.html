  <h2> Bad Neighborhood Relationships Due to Homeless Cats</h2>
  <p>Cats are everywhere in China. Nearly every public park and apartment complex has its own resident pack of strays. There is usually a group of cat lovers and a group of cat haters in the same residential area. The following report introduced how the poor homeless cats lead to bad neighborhood relationships.</p>
  <p>For Zhang, feeding the stray cats outside her apartment block has become a high-stakes stealth activity.</p>
  <p>Usually, she waits until after dark before sneaking out to lay down some kibble. If she has to go during the day, she first puts on a hat, face mask, and sunglasses to conceal her identity.</p>
  <p>Around 60 felines have taken up residence in Zhang’s housing complex — a large, modern development in eastern Shanghai — and their presence has split the neighborhood’s roughly 1,000 households into two polarized factions.</p>
  <p>The cat lovers are determined to care for the animals. They’ve assembled a huddle of small shelters and leave out piles of cat food each day. But they face bitter opposition from the community’s anti-cat residents, who complain about loud midnight yowling and occasional attacks on pet dogs.</p>
  <p>Relations between the groups are tense. On one occasion, the cat haters demolished the shelters during the night, forcing the cat lovers to rebuild them in a discreet spot behind some shrubs. Those bold enough to lay out kibble in broad daylight risk verbal abuse from passing locals.</p>
  <p>Zhang, a former teacher in her 50s, feels stuck in the middle. She’s so concerned about her neighbors discovering her pro-cat sympathies, she refuses to reveal her full name to Sixth Tone.</p>
  <p>“Every time I install a cat house or put out food in the compound, I … fear some residents will object and confront me and my family,” she says.</p>
  <p> Sometimes, thing got even more extreme when several cat haters actually poisoned the cats to death. The homeless cats are actually living in harsh environments.</p>

  <h2 class="black"> My Own Experience </h2>
  </div>

<div class="experience">
  <p> I started to feed the homeless cats with my mom during summer holidays when I was in highschool. We have seen many cute homeless cats died. We tried to save several that was in serious illness. However, when we got to the hospital, the veterinarian usually told us that it was too late and we could not save their lives.</p>
  <p> The reality is, that these cats were not adapt to the extreme wheathers. Moreover, the cat food they usually eat were the cheap and innutrious type. Moreover, they eat in the same places with the other stray cats and some of them were sick and the illness would spread. Therefore, these homeless cats usally develop several types of chronic disease. When the disease became serious which humans could recognize specific symptoms, it would already be too late.</p>
  <p> We realized that we should solve the problem from its root, that is to decrease the numbers of homeless cats and find homes for them when they are little. My mom joined the group of cat lovers in our residential area and I helped her to take picture for the homeless cats they saved and sent them online. We have helped about 10 cats to find home and below are some of the ones that are waiting for a home.</p>
  <p> Through the experience of helping the homeless cats to find home and learning about the ones that really get along with their owners. I really think every homelss cats is cute and deserve to have a warm family. Below I would also recommend an instagram influencer who takes photo of homeless cats in different cities of China and you can see how adorable they are. </p>
